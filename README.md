## Contributing

Open an issue describing the work you want to do (or want to be done, though it will be faster if you participate!).

Issues and pull requests should be named appropriately based on the issue they resolve. Branches should be named `issue-(issue number)-(feature)`. If there is no issue open for the changes you are making, just name the branch with your feature implemented. Branches should be all lowercase and spaces should be replaced with `-`. Pull requests should have `Closes #(issue number)` in the description (preferably at the end after the changes the PR makes), not the title. This will then link automatically link the PR and Issue.

Many editors and GUI git clients will help and even combine many of these commands. Refer to the documentation for whichever application you are using as well as [this guide](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/) with any questions.
